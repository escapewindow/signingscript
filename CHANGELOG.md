# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [3.0.3.dev1] - 2017-08-11
### Added
- `sign_widevine_zip` only extracts the files we need to sign, and appends the sigfiles to the original zipfile.
- `sign_widevine_tar` extracts the entire tarball, and recreates it with the sigfiles added. This is because compressed tarballs can't be appended to.
- `get_zipfile_files` and `get_tarfile_files` lets us list the contents of an archive without extracting.

### Changed
- `sign_signcode` now extracts to a new temp dir every time, to optimize for task runtime speed (no more nuking the same temp dir to reuse). This temp dir is under `work_dir`, so it should be cleaned up after the task is finished.
- `sign_widevine` now calls `sign_widevine_zip` or `sign_widevine_tar` as needed.
- `_should_sign_widevine` now takes a list of file paths, and returns a dictionary of `{path: signing_format, ...}`. If a file to sign exists, but its `.sig` file also exists, we no longer mark that file for re-signing.
- `_extract_zipfile` now allows for specifying a `files` kwarg. If specified, only extract those paths. If not, extract everything.
- `_create_zipfile` now allows for appending, via the new `mode` kwarg.

## [3.0.2] - 2017-08-09
### Fixed
- fixed `widevine_blessed` signing.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-08-07
### Fixed

## [3.0.0] - 2017-08-04
### Added

- py36 test support

### Changed
- Moved the `aiohttp.ClientSession` creation into `async_main`
- No longer close the event loop at the end of `main`
- `sign_file` no longer takes a `to` kwarg; we always overwrite the original file, due to zipfile signing logic.

### Added
- `example_server_config.json`
- 100% test coverage, with full docstrings and `flake8_docstrings`
- moved `SigningServer` named tuple out of function, for easier importing and reuse

- `get_default_config` now takes a `base_dir` kwarg
- moved `_execute_subprocess` to utils
- `sign_file` now returns the path to the target file
- `async_main` now copies the returned path to the `artifact_dir`

### Fixed
- close the event loop on `main()` exception

## [0.10.1] - 2017-02-09
### Fixed
- Fix an execution error due to the addition of zipalign

## [0.9.0] - 2016-12-08
### Changed
- look at `work_dir` for the downloaded artifacts, to match the latest scriptworker changes

## [0.8.2] - 2016-11-28
### Added
- added `token_duration_seconds` config item

### Changed

### Fixed

## Changed
- `copy_to_artifact_dir` is now `copy_to_dir`, and takes a `parent_dir` arg.

## Fixed
- copy `upstreamArtifacts` files from `artifact_dir` to `work_dir` before signing.  This means we no longer overwrite chain of trust artifacts with signed artifacts

## Fixed
- only copy files that aren't already in the appropriate `artifact_dir` location

## [0.7.0] - 2016-11-09
### Changed
- changed the task definition to use `upstreamArtifacts`, which allows for different sets of signing formats per file

## [0.6.0] - 2016-10-10
### Changed
- moved `download_artifacts` and `download_files` to scriptworker; compatible with `scriptworker>=0.7.0`

### Added
- `README.md` is now checked in.  Generate `README.rst` via pandoc.

### Changed
- update the READMEs to describe how the new `validate_artifact_url` calls change testing.
- `scriptworker.client.validate_task_schema` -> `scriptworker.client.validate_json_schema`

### Fixed

## [0.5.0] - 2016-08-19
### Changed
- `unsignedArtifacts` URLs will now be verified as valid TaskCluster artifact URLs for dependent tasks by default.
- tests no longer use nosetest syntax; they've been all ported to pytest syntax.

### Fixed
- `download_files` now uses the standard SSL trusted CAs.

## [0.4.1] - 2016-08-16
